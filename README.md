# YaraRules

This repository contains a collection of **YARA rules** created and maintained by [S12cybersecurity](https://github.com/S12cybersecurity).

As a malware developer, I use this space to publish detection rules for the techniques I implement during research and experimentation.  
These rules can help analysts, researchers, and security teams detect and study specific malicious behaviors.

## 📌 Purpose

- Share custom YARA rules focused on malware techniques.
- Support detection, hunting, and reverse engineering efforts.
- Provide practical resources for the cybersecurity community.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Each file corresponds to one or more detection rules.
- Rules are organized by technique or malware functionality.
- Updated as new techniques are tested and published.
